Determining the locale is outside the scope of this library but is required in [ex_cldr_person_names](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_cldr_person_names).

* Add `Unicode.script_dominance/1` to sort the results of `Unicode.script_statistic/1` in descending dominance order.

This is the changelog for Unicode v1.10.0 released on October 5th, 2020.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/elixir-unicode/unicode/tags)

### Bug fixes

* Add `:inets` and `:public_key` to `:extra_applicatons` to avoid warnings on Elixir 1.11.

### Enhancements

* Add `Unicode.assigned/0` to return the list of codepoint ranges that are assigned within Unicode

* Rename `Unicode.ranges/0` to `Unicode.all/0` to better reflect the intent. `Unicode.ranges/0` is deprecated.

## Unicode v1.4.0

This is the changelog for Unicode v1.4.0 released on March 11th, 2020.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/elixir-unicode/unicode/tags)

### Enhancements

#### Updates Unicode to version 13.0.

As of March 2020, Unicode has introduced [Unicode 13.0](http://blog.unicode.org/2020/03/announcing-unicode-standard-version-130.html) and this data now forms the basis of `ex_unicode` version 1.40. Version 13 of Unicode adds 5,390 characters, for a total of 143,859 characters. These additions include four new scripts, for a total of 154 scripts, as well as 55 new emoji characters.

#### Adds derived categories for various quotation marks.

Although the unicode character database has a flag to indicate if a given codepoint is a quotation mark, the list does not include CJK quotation marks, dingbats or alternative encodings. Some additional derived categories are therefore added that are taken from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark). The added dervived categories are:

  * QuoteMark - all quote marks
  * QuoteMarkLeft - all quote marks used on the left
  * QuoteMarkRight - quote marks used on the right
  * QuoteMarkAmbidextrous - quote marks used either left or right
  * QuoteMarkSingle - single quote marks
  * QuoteMarkDouble - double quote marks

These additional derived categories can be used in [Unicode Sets](https://hex.pm/packages/unicode_sets), for example:

```elixir
iex> Unicode.Set.match? ?', "[[:quote_mark:]]"
true
iex> Unicode.Set.match? ?', "[[:quote_mark_left:]]"
false
iex> Unicode.Set.match? ?', "[[:quote_mark_ambidextrous:]]"
true
```

## Unicode v1.3.1

This is the changelog for Unicode v1.3.1 released on January 8th, 2020.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/elixir-unicode/unicode/tags)

### Bug Fixes

* Remove call to `Code.ensure_compiled?/1` which is deprecated in Elixir 1.10.0.

* Fix the ranges for the General Category `:assigned`.

## Unicode v1.3.0

This is the changelog for Unicode v1.3.0 released on December 3rd, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/elixir-unicode/unicode/tags)

### Breaking Changes

* Changed two module names: `Unicode.Category` becomes `Unicode.GeneralCategory` and `Unicode.CombiningClass` becomes `Unicode.CanonicalCombiningClass`. These names map directly to the Unicode standard names. It also means all property module names can be derived from the Unicode property name which is what the new `Unicode.servers/0` function does.

### Enhancements

* Add property modules for line break, sentence break, grapheme cluster break and indic syllabic category. These properties are used by the CLDR and Unicode segmentation rules.

* Add `Unicode.servers/0` that maps property names and aliases to a module name that serves that property.

### Bug fixes

* Fixes `Unicode.aliases/0` to correctly use the aliases in `data/property_alias.txt`

## Unicode v1.2.0

This is the changelog for Unicode v1.2.0 released on November 27th, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/elixir-unicode/unicode/tags)

### Breaking Changes

* Script names are now atoms instead of strings to be consistent with other properties

### Enhancements

* Add `aliases/0`, `fetch/1` and `get/1` to `Unicode.Property`

* Added additional properties to `Unicode.Property`. The set now includes those from the UCD files `DerivedCoreProperties.txt` and `PropList.txt`.

## Unicode v1.1.0

This is the changelog for Unicode v1.1.0 released on November 23rd, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/elixir-unicode/unicode/tags)

### Breaking Changes

* Removed `Unicode.Guards` from this library and moved them to the [unicode_set](https://hex.pm/packages/unicode_guards) package.

### Enhancements

* `Unicode.Category.categories/0` now returns the super categories as well as the subcategories. These super categories are computed at compile time by consolidating the relevant subcategories. `Unicode.Category.category/1` will only return one category, and it will be the subcategory as it consistent with earlier releases.

* Add `Unicode.ranges/0` that returns all Unicode codepoints as a list of 2-tuples representing the disjoint ranges of valid codepoints. The list is in sorted order.

* Add `aliases/0` for `Unicode.Category`, `Unicode.Script`, `Unicode.Block`, and `Unicode.CombiningClass` which returns the alias map for the relevant module.

* Add `fetch/1` and `get/1` for `Unicode.Category`, `Unicode.Script`, `Unicode.Block`, and `Unicode.CombiningClass`. These functions leverage Unicode property value aliases for retrieving codepoints.

* Add `Unicode.fetch_property/1` and `Unicode.get_property/1` that return the module responsible for handling a given Unicode property.

* Add `Unicode.compact_ranges/1` that given a list of 2-tuple ranges will compact them into as small a list of contiguous blocks as possible

* Documented all public functions

## Unicode v1.0.0

This is the changelog for Unicode v1.0.0 released on November 14th, 2019.  For older changelogs please consult the release tag on [GitHub](https://github.com/elixir-unicode/unicode/tags)

### Breaking Changes

* Rename the module prefix to `Unicode` since this package is not linked in any way to the `Cldr` family. The hex package is renamed to `ex_unicode`.

## Cldr Unicode v0.7.1
